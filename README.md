Welcome to the DOS Game Launcher!
At the top right are your standard buttons to close and minimize the application. 
In the opposite corner, you can see our logo. Clicking that will show some additional information and a URL directing to this page.
Underneath those, there are dropdown menus where you can select which game to play. Make sure only one of these has a game selected at a time, otherwise the game in Developer's Favorites will be the one that opens when you click play! You can empty it by clicking the empty selection in the list.
At the bottom right there's the version number. If you need to make a bug report, please make note of what version of the program you are using!
Next to that, there's the play button. Click this after selecting a game to play to launch it.
Opposite that, in the bottom left corner, there's a button you can click to open the website, a button that links to the Discord server, and a button that opens a dialogue box with helpful information
